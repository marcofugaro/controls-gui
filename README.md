# controls-gui

> A GUI for managing state

## Installation

```
npm install -S controls-gui
```

## Stability

This library should still be considered experimental. It will definitely obey semantic versioning, but it will hopefully increment quickly as I use it and adapt it to real-world needs.

## Introduction

Created to start addressing the challenges and common patterns observed in similar projects like [control-panel](https://www.npmjs.com/package/control-panel) and [dat.gui](https://github.com/dataarts/dat.gui). Heavily inspired by the proxy-based interface [proposed by Matt DesLauriers](https://twitter.com/mattdesl/status/1018541276340187136)â€”exept with out actual proxies for the sake of compatibility.
